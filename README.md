SSStringExtension is a lightweight string extension for Swift. This library was motivated by having to search StackOverflow for common string operations, and wanting them to be in one place with test coverage.

## Requirements

## Installation

SSStringExtension is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
